Development Workflow
Branching and Merging: All development should be done using the branching and merging strategy.
Create branches based on your sprint tasks and name them accordingly.
Work exclusively within your branch on the modules related to your task to minimize merge conflicts.
If your task requires changes in other modules, coordinate with the respective team member.
Commit changes frequently but merge branches into the master branch infrequently.
Use pull requests for merging, linking your branch with the pull request for a review before merging into the master branch.
