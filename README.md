Supports development IDEs on Windows and Mac, preferably through Visual Studio. 

The product is a Mobile App, currently developed through Xamarin application. An Android or IOS enulator is recommended for debugging purposes. 

Development is done exclusively through Branching and Merging. 

Create branches based on your sprint tasks and name them accordingly. Only edit modules that pertain to your task to avoid merge conflicts. 
If your task depends on other modules outside of your branch domain, communicate with the team member for that module and work out a solution. 
Commit changes frequently and merge branches infrequently. 
When merging, open a pull request in git, link your branch with the pull request, and merge it into master.
